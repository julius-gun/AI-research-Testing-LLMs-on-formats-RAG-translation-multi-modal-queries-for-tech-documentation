Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?
Expected Answer: 40kg/min
Model Response: I am very sure. It is advised to use the fine application when the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min, according to the spreading chart that provides this information for different working widths of the spreader.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): no
Time taken: 30.08 seconds

Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?
Expected Answer: 30 degrees
Model Response: Based on the given context, I conclude that the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30° when lifted. 

The mention of "when lifted" suggests a specific position or range of operation, which typically indicates a limited working angle. In this case, it appears to be the maximum possible angle under these conditions.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 29.98 seconds

Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?
Expected Answer: You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.
Model Response: Based on the provided context, I am very sure that the following materials are required for performing the tray test:

1. Measuring tape or ruler
2. Spirit level
3. 7 troughs
4. 7 graduated tubes
5. 1 funnel
6. Notebook, pen and calculator
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 37.45 seconds

Question: What is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min?
Expected Answer: Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600
Model Response: The general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min, based on the given context, appears to be:

Flowrate (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)

This can be derived from the formula provided on page 600: 

Flowrate (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)

I am very sure that this is indeed the correct formula.

Model Response: The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft when lifted and lowered is 30°.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 43.57 seconds

Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?
Expected Answer: You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.
Model Response: The relevant sentence for answering the question is:

"Material required: •measuring tape or ruler, •spirit level to set the troughs horizontal, •7 troughs, •7 graduated tubes, •1 funnel, •notebook, pen and calculator,"
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 67.56 seconds

Question: What is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min?
Expected Answer: Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600
Model Response: According to the context, the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is:

flowrate (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 65.98 seconds


Model: llama3.1
--------------------------------------------------
Accuracy: 100.0% (4/4 correct answers)

Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?
Expected Answer: 40kg/min
Model Response: It is advised to make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 226.90 seconds

Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?
Expected Answer: 30 degrees
Model Response: The relevant sentence from the context is:

"The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30° when lifted and 30° when lowered."

Therefore, my concise answer to your question is:

The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30°.

Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?
Expected Answer: You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.
Model Response: Here is the relevant sentence from the context:

"Material required
•measuring tape or ruler,
•spirit level to set the troughs horizontal,
•7 troughs,
•7 graduated tubes,
•1 funnel,
•notebook, pen and calculator,
•this manual.
•the instruction manual of the software."

The materials required to perform the tray test are:

Measuring tape or ruler
Spirit level to set the troughs horizontal
7 troughs
7 graduated tubes
1 funnel
Notebook, pen, and calculator
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
