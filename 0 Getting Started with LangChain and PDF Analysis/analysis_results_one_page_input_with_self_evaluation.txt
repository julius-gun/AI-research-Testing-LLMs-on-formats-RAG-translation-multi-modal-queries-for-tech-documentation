Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?
Expected Answer: 40kg/min
Model Response: At a flowrate of 40 kg/min.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 32.69 seconds

Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?
Expected Answer: 30 degrees
Model Response: Based on the given context, the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30° when lifted and 30° when lowered.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 23.10 seconds

Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?
Expected Answer: You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.
Model Response: Based on the context, I am quite sure that the materials required for performing the tray test include:

* A measuring tape or ruler
* A spirit level
* 7 troughs
* 7 graduated tubes
* A funnel
* A notebook
* A pen and calculator
* The instruction manual of the software
* And a calculator is mentioned again

Additionally, I believe that the material required for performing the tray test may also be:

* Notebooks (to keep records of observations)

However, based on the provided context, it seems most likely that only these basic materials are required.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): no
Time taken: 46.34 seconds

Question: What is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min?
Expected Answer: Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600
Model Response: The general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min appears to be:

Flowrate (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) / Application rate (kg/ha)

Is this correct?
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 34.84 seconds

Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?
Expected Answer: 40kg/min
Model Response: The relevant sentence from the context is:

"We therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min."
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): no
Time taken: 72.42 seconds

Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?
Expected Answer: 30 degrees
Model Response: The relevant sentence from the context that answers the question is:

"The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30° when lifted and 30° when lowered."

Therefore, the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30°.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 45.75 seconds

Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?
Expected Answer: You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.
Model Response: The relevant sentence is:

"Material required
•measuring tape or ruler,
•spirit level to set the troughs horizontal,
•7 troughs,
•7 graduated tubes,
•1 funnel,
•notebook, pen and calculator,"
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): no
Time taken: 62.73 seconds

Question: What is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min?
Expected Answer: Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600
Model Response: The relevant sentence is:

flowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)

This suggests that the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is a multiplication of three factors: working width, driving speed, and application rate.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 65.95 seconds


Model: llama3.1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?
Expected Answer: 40kg/min
Model Response: According to the context, it is advised to use the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): no
Time taken: 209.02 seconds

Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?
Expected Answer: 30 degrees
Model Response: The relevant sentence for your question is:

"The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30° when lifted and 30° when lowered." 

So, the answer to your question is: 30°.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 176.50 seconds

Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?
Expected Answer: You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.
Model Response: The relevant sentence is:
"Material required
•measuring tape or ruler,
•spirit level to set the troughs horizontal,
•7 troughs,
•7 graduated tubes,
•1 funnel,
•notebook, pen and calculator,
•this manual.
•the instruction manual of the software."

The answer is: A measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, a pen, a calculator, this manual, and the instruction manual of the software.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 240.97 seconds

Question: What is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min?
Expected Answer: Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600
Model Response: Here is the relevant sentence from the context:

"600flowrate required (kg/min) =Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)"

This is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min.
Self-Evaluation (Correct?): yes
Time taken: 221.27 seconds
