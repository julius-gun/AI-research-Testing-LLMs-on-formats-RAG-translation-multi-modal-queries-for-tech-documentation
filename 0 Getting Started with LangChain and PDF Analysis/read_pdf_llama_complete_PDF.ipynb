      "Expected Answer: 40kg/min; page 67\n",
      "Model Response: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the provided context, a flow rate of 0.7 kg/min is recommended for fine application.\n",
      "\n",
      "The correct text from the original document states:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fine application - should be done at 0.7 kg/min (6.33 psi)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer to your question is: **0.7 kg/min**\n",

      "Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?\n",
      "Expected Answer: 30 degrees; Page 54\n",
      "Model Response: The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft depends on various factors, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The type of fertiliser being applied (e.g., granular, mineral, etc.)\n",
      "* The specific application rate setting\n",
      "* The working method used (e.g., ExactLine, full field, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Without more detailed information about the application or specific settings, it's challenging to provide a precise answer. However, I can offer some general guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most cases, the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is around 90-95 degrees. This allows for optimal distribution and uniformity of the fertiliser throughout the field.\n",

      "Model Response: According to the context, the tray test is used to verify that there are no solids in the fertilizer before it is loaded into the spreader. Specifically, the following materials are likely required for the tray test:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Trays or containers: These are used to collect any debris or solids that may be present on the fertilizer.\n",
      "2. Water: A water source is typically needed to rinse out the trays and test them for solid particles.\n",
      "3. Measuring cups or spoons: To accurately measure out a small sample of the fertilizer, which can help detect any impurities.\n",

      "Flow rate (kg/min) = Desired output / Desired application time\n",

      "\n",
      "In many cases, the required flowrate of fertilizer (e.g., granular or prill-based products) is calculated using the following general equation:\n",
      "\n",

      "* Application Rate is the rate at which fertilizer should be applied per square meter (typically expressed in kg/m² or g/m³)\n",
      "* Working Width is the width of the machine's application area (in meters)\n",
      "* Distance refers to the distance between the fertilizer dispenser and the desired point of application (usually a fixed value for each spreader type)\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that this is a simplified approach, and actual calculations might require additional factors such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Fertilizer particle size and distribution\n",
      "* Application method (e.g., broadcast, banding, or row-by-row)\n",
