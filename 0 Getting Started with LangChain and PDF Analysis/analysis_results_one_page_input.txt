Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?
Expected Answer: ['40kg/min', 67]
Model Response: Based on the provided context, I am very sure that at a flowrate of 40 kg/min or more, it is advised to use the fine application. According to the text, "With a low application rate and/or a low driving speed the dosing openings are only opened a slight bit so that  very little fertiliser would stream through the dosing openings of the spreader."
Time taken: 34.03 seconds

Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?
Expected Answer: ['30 degrees', 54]
Model Response: Based on the provided context, the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30 degrees when lifted and 30 degrees when lowered.
Time taken: 16.74 seconds

Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?
Expected Answer: ["You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.", 77]
Model Response: Based on the context, you need measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, and calculator. Additionally, the instruction manual of the software is mentioned, but it's not clear if this includes all necessary materials.
Time taken: 26.84 seconds

Question: What is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min?
Expected Answer: ['Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600', 68]
Model Response: Based on the provided context, I am very sure that the correct formula to calculate the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is:

600flowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)

This formula takes into account the factors mentioned in the context, such as the working width and driving speed, and converts them to a common unit (kg/ha).
Time taken: 29.77 seconds


Model: llama3.2
--------------------------------------------------
Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?
Expected Answer: ['40kg/min', 67]
Model Response: According to the context, it is advised to make use of the "fine application" if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min.
Time taken: 60.90 seconds

Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?
Expected Answer: ['30 degrees', 54]
Model Response: The relevant sentence that answers the question is:

"The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30° when lifted and 30° when lowered."
Time taken: 41.41 seconds

Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?
Expected Answer: ["You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.", 77]
Model Response: According to the context, the following materials are required to perform the tray test:

1. Measuring tape or ruler
2. Spirit level to set the troughs horizontal
3. 7 troughs
4. 7 graduated tubes
5. 1 funnel
6. Notebook, pen and calculator
Time taken: 61.53 seconds

Question: What is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min?
Expected Answer: ['Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600', 68]
Model Response: The relevant sentence from the context that answers the question is:

"flowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)"
Time taken: 56.96 seconds


Model: llama3.1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?
Expected Answer: ['40kg/min', 67]
Model Response: According to the context, it is advised to use the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min. 

The relevant sentence is:
"We therefore advise that you make use of the fine application if the flowrate is less than 40 kg/min."
Time taken: 186.31 seconds

Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?
Expected Answer: ['30 degrees', 54]
Model Response: Based on the context, the relevant sentence that answers the question is:

"The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30° when lifted and 30° when lowered."

So, the answer to the question is: The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft is 30° (when lifted) and 30° (when lowered).
Time taken: 135.42 seconds

Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?
Expected Answer: ["You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.", 77]
Model Response: Here is the relevant sentence from the context:

"Material required
•measuring tape or ruler,
•spirit level to set the troughs horizontal,
•7 troughs,
•7 graduated tubes,
•1 funnel,
•notebook, pen and calculator,
•this manual.
•the instruction manual of the software."

Based on this information, I am very sure that the following materials are required to perform the tray test:

* Measuring tape or ruler
* Spirit level to set the troughs horizontal
* 7 troughs
* 7 graduated tubes
* 1 funnel
* Notebook, pen and calculator
* This manual (presumably for reference)
* The instruction manual of the software
Time taken: 222.78 seconds

Question: What is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min?
Expected Answer: ['Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600', 68]
Model Response: The relevant sentence that answers the question is:

"flowrate required (kg/min) = Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha)"

This sentence provides the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min.
