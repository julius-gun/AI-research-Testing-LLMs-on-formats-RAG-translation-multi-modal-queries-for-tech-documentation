      "Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?\n",
      "Expected Answer: ['40kg/min', 67]\n",
      "Model Response: According to the text, it's not explicitly stated when or at what flowrate of fertilizer (in kg/min) should be used for the fine application. However, I can provide some general guidelines based on common practices in agriculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, a fine application rate is considered as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 20-30 kg/min: For areas with moderate weed pressure and few weeds\n",
      "* 15-25 kg/min: For areas with moderate weed pressure and some weeds\n",
      "* Less than 15 kg/min: For areas with heavy weed pressure or many weeds\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these are general guidelines and the optimal fine application rate may vary depending on the specific field conditions, crop type, and pest management practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also worth mentioning that the text mentions \"variable, externally driven application rate\" which suggests that the control system of the spreader can adjust the fine application rate based on real-time data from sensors or other sources.\n",
      "Time taken: 71.92 seconds\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?\n",
      "Expected Answer: ['30 degrees', 54]\n",
      "Model Response: The maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft in a spreader system can be determined by considering the distribution characteristics of the fertiliser.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the text, when determining the distribution of granules with a distribution meter, you fill each slot with different sizes of granules (4.75 mm, 7-3.3 mm, 30% between 3.3-4.75 mm, and none larger than 4.75 mm) and shake it for several times to ensure that no smaller granules are falling through the sieves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text also states that you should round off any remaining percentages after shaking to obtain an average distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, based on this information, we can determine the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft by considering the size of the largest granule in each slot. The largest granule corresponds to the 4.75 mm slot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text does not provide a specific measurement or calculation for determining the operating angle, but it suggests that you should consider the diameter of the largest granule when calculating the maximum operating angle.\n",
      "Time taken: 76.88 seconds\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What materials are required to perform the tray test?\n",
      "Expected Answer: [\"You'll need a measuring tape or ruler, a spirit level, 7 troughs, 7 graduated tubes, a funnel, a notebook, pen, calculator, this manual, and the software's instruction manual.\", 77]\n",
      "Model Response: The required materials for performing the tray test according to the context are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A tractor with a spreading disc\n",
      "2. Troughs\n",
      "3. Dosing units (for both left and right sides of the tractor tracks)\n",
      "4. Driving speed (as specified in the relevant spreading chart)\n",
      "\n",
      "These materials enable you to perform the full field spreading pattern test, which is described on page 80 of the context.\n",
      "Time taken: 57.04 seconds\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the general formula for calculating the required flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min?\n",
      "Expected Answer: ['Working width (m) x Driving speed (km/h) x Application rate (kg/ha) / 600', 68]\n",
      "Model Response: The general formula for calculating the required flow rate of fertilizer (fertilizer volume per minute) is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Required Flow Rate = Total Fertilizer Volume / Required Application Area\n",
      "\n",
      "This implies that the required flow rate depends on two factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The total amount of fertilizer being applied.\n",
      "2. The area over which the fertilizers are being applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, without more specific details about the system or machine used for the calibration and application of the fertilizer, it's difficult to provide a precise formula. But in general terms, you would need to know the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Total Fertilizer Volume (in kg/min)\n",
      "* Required Application Area (in m²)\n",
      "\n",
      "By dividing these two values, you can obtain the required flow rate in kg/min.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, let's say we have 10 liters of fertilizer per minute being applied over an area of 1,000 square meters. To calculate the required flow rate:\n",
      "\n",
      "Required Flow Rate = Total Fertilizer Volume / Required Application Area\n",
      "= 10 L/min (converting from liters to kilograms)\n",
      "/ 1,000 m²\n",
      "= 0.01 kg/min\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in this example, we would need approximately 0.01 kilograms of fertilizer per minute to be applied over an area of 1,000 square meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that this is a simplified example and actual calculations may vary depending on the specific system or machine being used.\n",

      "Question: At which flowrate of fertilizer in kg/min is it advised to use the fine application?\n",
      "Expected Answer: ['40kg/min', 67]\n",
      "Model Response: The provided text does not explicitly state the recommended flowrate for a fine application, but based on the table that appears to be part of the manual calibration test, I can provide an estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the table, it seems that the flowrates are in kg/min. The column labeled \"kg/ha\" represents the spreader's capacity in liters per hectare, and the column labeled \"kg/min\" represents the flowrate in kilograms per minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we look at the row for a fine application (5.0 kg/ha), it seems that the corresponding flowrate is 150-200 kg/min. However, without more information about the specific fertilizer being used or the desired application rate, it's difficult to provide an exact answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also worth noting that the manual calibration test mentions that rinsing the calibration container greatly improves accuracy and that all parts of the container where fertilizers could remain are now filled. This suggests that the flowrate may need to be adjusted depending on the specific fertilizer being used or the amount left in the calibration container.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I would recommend consulting the user's manual for more specific guidance on applying fine fertilizers at optimal flowrates.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft?\n",
      "Expected Answer: ['30 degrees', 54]\n",
      "Model Response: The context doesn't mention the maximum operating angle of the coupling shaft. The context appears to be related to fertilizers, spreading charts, distribution meters, and granule sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can provide some general information about coupling shafts. Unfortunately, without more specific information or context, it's difficult to determine the exact specifications of a particular coupling shaft, including its maximum operating angle.\n",
      "\n",

      "Model Response: According to the context, the following materials are not explicitly mentioned as being required for the tray test, but rather implied:\n",

      "1. The tractor (which is likely a agricultural vehicle or a spreader)\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Fertilizer, seeds, or granules (used in the test to evaluate the spreading pattern)\n",
      "2. Fuel (for the tractor engine)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "However, I can suggest a possible approach to find the answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Look for any relevant text or tables on page 70 that mention the term \"fine application\" or \"fine settings.\"\n",
      "2. Check if there are any specific flowrates mentioned in those sections.\n",
